# Clean-LAPOP
This repo contains the data for the Latin American Public Opinion Project. With this information, we aim to create web-based, interactive, self-guided analytics.

## Getting Started
These are the steps you should take to begin using this repo.

### Prerequisites
You will need the current version of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop) to run this code.

Additionally, you will need to download all of the merged files that exist for each country individually from the [LAPOP Datasets](http://datasets.americasbarometer.org/database/index.php)

These files will need to be placed into the working directory of your project in RStudio.

### Suggested Workflow
1-Reading in Data

2-Finding Common Columns

3-Shrinking to Common Columns

4-Combining vb11_12 and vb11_10

5-Creating Unique ID and Numbered Column

6-Creating NA

7-Gather and Spread
