# Structure

Now that we finally have a single dataframe with all the countries with only the common questions, we need to widen it so that it fits within Tableau Public's limit.

In order to do this we are going to:

* combine columns into the format of "category:question text"
* select the necessary columns (country, wave, person_id, weight, category:question text)

```{r}
library(rlang)
```

## Combining category and question
```{r}
countries_common_only <- countries_common_only %>% 
  unite(category_question, category, question, sep = ":")
```
